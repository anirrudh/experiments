# Experiments

This repository contains "fun code" that is PURELY EXPERIMENTAL. To manage software, I'll be utilizing nix and conda. Notes will be in the folder but typically will be rendered markdown and jupyter notebooks. 

## Software 

I'll be swapping between two platforms:

- macOS (arm64) with GPU 
- linux (x86) with CUDA
